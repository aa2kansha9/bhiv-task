# Standalone Logic Engine

A modular, non-AI rule evaluation engine that processes input objects against configurable rules and produces structured output.

## Features

- **Threshold Rules**: Compare numeric values against thresholds (>, <, ≥, ≤, =, ≠, between)
- **Keyword Rules**: Text pattern matching (any, all, exact match)
- **Custom Function Rules**: JavaScript functions as conditions
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend with new rule types
- **Structured Output**: Tags, alerts, and detailed summaries

## Installation

```bash
